This project integrates GIS analysis into a web map using Mapbox GL JS and Turf.js. 

The map visualizes pedestrian and cyclist collision data in City of Toronto and included a dynamically generated hex-grid aggregation layer.

Features:   

    Displayed collision location as point features.

    Generated a hex-grid overlay using Turf.js to aggregate collision counts in each covered area.
        Hex-grid layer removable.   
    
    Collision counts are classified and used colour gradients for visual hierarchy.

    Implemented a bounding box visualization.

    Interactive layer control to toggle the hex-grid.
